	 <h1>Thank you for taking part in this study</h1>
	 <p>This experiment tested your ability to recognise small pronunciation differences and associate them with different speaker groups. We think that the way in which different pronuncations become associated with different groups of speakers might affect the way that dialects change over time.</p>

	 <p>The voices that you heard included examples of sounds which are said to be changing in York speech:</p>
	 <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
 		 <li>The vowel in words like 'face', 'late' and 'pay'</li>
  		<li>The vowel in words like 'goat', 'home' and 'road'</li>
  		<li>The vowel in words like 'goose', 'pool' and 'suit'</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By analyzing lots of recordings of York speakers of different ages, we can see that these sounds are changing; in many cases, it seems that young people from York are starting to speak more like people from Southern England.</p>
	<p>However, the speed at which people are adopting these new sounds is different: people seem more willing to change their pronunciation of the vowel in 'goose' than they are of 'face' or 'goat'. One reason for this might be that they feel that the traditional way of saying 'face' and 'goat' is more attractive, or more accurately reflects their social identity, while the older form of 'goose' isn't so important.</p>
	<p>My project tries to explain the way these sounds are changing by comparing the way people speak with the way they perceive and socially evaluate these changing pronunciations.</p>
	<p>By studying the way English pronunciation is changing, we are better able to understand language from a scientific perspective, as well as documenting this important part of our cultural heritage for generations to come. </p>
